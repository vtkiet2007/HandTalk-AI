# HandTalk-AI

HandTalk-AI is an innovative project bridging the gap between hand gesture recognition and real-time communication, powered by advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and ESP32-CAM technology.

## 🚀 About the Project

HandTalk-AI is designed to interpret hand gestures using computer vision and deep learning, enabling seamless translation of sign language or gesture-based commands into meaningful digital outputs. This project leverages affordable hardware (ESP32-CAM) and state-of-the-art neural networks to make gesture recognition accessible to everyone.
